title: Hallo World, Hallo Clojit
---


We have been quietly developing a new Virtual Maschine for Clojure. We are now at the point where we think that we have some valuable information to share with others and hope to generate more information in the future.

We also hope that this blog will serve as resource for the architecture and design decisions of the project.

You can find more information about Clojit on the <a href="about"> About Page </a> and the <a href="resources"> Resource Page </a>.

Check back for more posts soon.
