We are building a new VM (Virtual machine) for the Clojure language. We want to stress that this VM is in no way beeing developed to replace JVM Clojure.
</p>

<p>
Since this project needed a name, we did what all unimaginative Hackers do, and just cramed our project goals into the name. Thus we call this project Clojit, Clojure + JIT.
</p>

<p>
This project falls under the category 'serious hobby project', we work on it because its fun. We have no goals beyond making cool open source software and learn more about all the aspects of computer science.
</p>
<p>
If you have any intrest in this project, please contact us with you questions, comments, rants or best of all with a pull request. Since our goal is more then anything learning, we hope that we can start a conversation with any hobbiests or professionals who work, or wants to work, on a simular projects.
