<p>
  We are building a new VM (Virtual machine) for the Clojure language. We want to stress that this VM is in no way beeing developed to replace JVM Clojure.
</p>

<p>
  Since this project needed a name, we did what all unimaginative hackers do, and just cramed our project goals into the name. Thus we call this project Clojit, Clojure + JIT (Just in Time Compiler).
</p>

<p>
  This project falls under the category 'serious hobby project', we work on it because its fun. We have no goals beyond making cool open source software and learn more about all the aspects of computer science.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any intrest in this project, please contact us with you questions, comments, rants or best of all with pull requests. Since our goal is more then anything learning, we hope that we can start a conversation with any hobbiests or professionals who work, or wants to work, on a simular projects.
</p>


<p> So who are the people behind this project? </p>

<p>
  <h3> Nick Zbinden aka nickik </h3>

  <p> I came up with this project because I was always facinated by JIT compilers and it has been a long time goal of mine to build one. I had read enougth, it was time to start writing code. At this point I reached out to my friend gandro and asked him if he was intrested in joining me.  </p>

  <p>
  I have been doing Clojure since about 1.0 and I choice it because it is a nice language and relativly simple. Im also intrested in exploring how immutable data can be used by VM (JIT and GC). <p>

    <p> Outside of this project and Clojure I am Web Devloper currently working in Java, but I have also done Android and IOS apps. <p>
