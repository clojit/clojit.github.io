<p>
  We are building a new VM (Virtual Machine) for the Clojure language. We want to stress, that this VM is in no way being developed to replace JVM Clojure.
</p>

<p>
  Since this project needed a name, we did what all unimaginative hackers do and just crammed our project goals into the name. Thus we call this project Clojit, Clojure + JIT (Just in Time Compiler).
</p>

<p>
  This project falls under the category 'serious hobby project'. We work on it because it's fun. We have no goals beyond making cool open source software and learning more about all aspects of computer science.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any interest in this project, please contact us with you questions, comments, rants or best of all with pull requests. Since our goal is all about learning, we hope that we can start a dialogue with any enthusiasts or professionals who work on similar projects.

  <h3> Nick Zbinden aka nickik </h3>

  <p> I initated this project, because I have been fascinated by JIT Compilers for a long time and have wanted to build one myself. I had prepared enough, it was time to start writing code. At this point, I talked about the idea with my friend gandro and asked him if he was interested in joining me.

  I have been working with Clojure since v1.0 and I chose it because it is a simple, well designed language but still has some advanced features that make it challenging. I'm also interested in exploring how immutable data can be used to optimise the VM (JIT and GC). <p>

    <p> My dayjob is working as a Web Developer and I'm currently working in Java, but I have also worked on Android. <p>
